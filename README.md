# 16.3-ES6-Arrow-Function

Watching these videos has taught me that the arrow function is a more concise way of writing a function and it is used with ES6. It also allows the function to remember or keep track of values, which is a benefit when comparing it to the previous way of declaring a function. Functional programming also uses pure functions, which mean that the same thing will always be returned. 

I have also learned that one of the main purposes of the functional style programming is to make things simpler for the programmers. Their objective is to make it so that they only have one thing to think about at a time. For example when using for loops you have to pay attention to the iteration and the worker code. Instead of seperating these two types of code, functional programming (arrow functions) allows us to put them in the same spot and consequently requires less brain power.
